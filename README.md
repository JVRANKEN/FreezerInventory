# FreezerInventory
Purpose of this application is to keep an inventory of your freezer. 
It is possible to catalog your freezer items. 
Important are the expiry dates, and the date items go into the freezer + max defined dates per item.

This way we keep an overview on items that need to be eaten fast and we won't forget any leftovers.
